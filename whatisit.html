		<h1>What is HAARP?</h1>

		<p>HAARP is supposedly a "High-frequency Active Auroral Research Program", meant to study the Earth's
			"ionosphere"</p>
		<h3>YEAH RIGHT!</h3>
		<p>According to the <a href="https://haarp.gi.alaska.edu/">alaskan news blog</a>, "Observation of the processes
			resulting from the use of the IRI in a controlled manner will allow scientists to better understand
			processes that occur continuously under the natural stimulation of the sun."</p>
		<p>"Its purpose was to analyze the ionosphere and investigate the potential for developing ionospheric
			enhancement technology for radio communications and surveillance."</p>
		<h3>Yeah! Sure! Just like how the CIA didn't kill JFK!</h3>
		<p>We cant trust HAARP!</p>
